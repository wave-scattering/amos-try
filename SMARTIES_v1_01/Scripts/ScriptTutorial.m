%% ScriptTutorial
% Example script providing a step-by-step tutorial to solve the scattering
% problem at a single wavelength, with explicit calls to the low-level
% functions used in the calculations of intermediate quantities.
%
% As such, this script provides a more in-depth understanding of the code
% than provided by the other example scripts. For a more application-oriented
% perspective, the "ScriptSolve" family of scripts use pre-defined functions
% performing the same steps internally, but invisible to the end-user.
%%

%% Description
%
% The example considers an absorbing dielectric (s=1.5+0.02i) in the shape
% of prolate spheroid of aspect ratio 10, and size parameter 10.
% The script calculate the T-matrix up to multipole order N and for all 0<=m<N
% From it various optical properties are also derived:
%%
% * Orientation-averaged extinction, scattering, and absorption
%   cross-sections.
% * Extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections for a given
%   incident field (KxEz in this example, meaning incident along x and polarized along z)
% * Surface fields (angular variation and surface-averaged intensity)
%   for a given incident field (KxEz here)

%% Initialization
%
% Note that you need to run InitPath in the root folder first to add
% required folders to the Matlab path so that functions can be called
% Alternatively, uncomment the following line
%
%   run('..\InitPath');
%
clear
close all

fprintf('Initialization and finding NQ and NB...\n');
tic; % for timer


%% Scatterer properties
% The following parameters should be defined:
%%
% * a: semi-axis along x,y
% * c: semi-axis along z
% * k1: wavevector in embedding medium (of refractive index nM) (k1=2*pi*nM/lambda)
% * s: relative refractive index (s=n_Particle / nM)
%
% In addition, the following parameter will be needed if field expansion coefficients
% and/or the cross-sections for a given fixed orientation are sought:
%%
% * stIncPar:  structure defining the incident excitation, can be obtained
%              from calling vshMakeIncidentParameters
%
% For actual field calculations (such as surface fields), we will also need
%%
% * nNbThetaPst: Number of theta's for postprocessing (must usually be
%                larger than nNbTheta for accurate surface averaging)
% * lambda:      wavelength (in free space) [in the same unit as a, c, k1^{-1}]
% * epsilon2:   relative dielectric constant of scatterer (possibly complex)
% * epsilon1:    relative dielectric constant of embedding medium (real
%                positive)
% Note that the latter three are not independent if k1 and s have been set


%% Parameters of the scattering problem
% We define parameters for a prolate spheroid
%
% <<../fig/schematicp.png>>
%
h = 2; % aspect ratio, h=c/a for prolate spheroids
k1 = 1; % incident wavenumber k1=2pi/lambda * nM
xmax = 10; % maximumum size parameter xmax= k1 * max(a,c)
% From which we deduce
c = xmax / k1
a = c / h

epsilon2 = (1.5+0.02i)^2 % dielectric constant of scatterer
epsilon1 = 1;
lambda = 2*pi*sqrt(epsilon1)/k1;
s = sqrt(epsilon2)/sqrt(epsilon1);
% note that only s is needed for T-matrix but other parameters are needed for E-field calculations

% For convenience, k1 and s are stored in a struct
stk1s.k1=k1;
stk1s.s=s;
% Incident field properties (if required)
sIncType='KxEz'; % incident along x  and polarized along z
% type  help vshMakeIncidentParameters for more options (plane wave excitation only)


%% Parameters governing convergence
% The following parameters will be needed:
%%
% * N:        Number of multipoles required for T-matrix
% * abmvec:   Vector containing the values of |m| for which T is computed
%             Only m>=0 is needed and m<=N.
%             For all m, use absmvec=0:N (= [0,1,2 ..., N] )
% * NQ:       Number of multipoles for the P and Q matrix, NQ>=N
% * NB:       Number of multipoles to compute the Bessel functions
%             in the improved algorithm, NB>=NQ.
% * nNbTheta: Number of theta's for the Gaussian quadrature

% Number of points for Gaussian quadratures to compute integrals in P and Q matrices
% By symmetry, points are only computed from that=0 to pi/2
nNbTheta = 120;
% Maximum multipole order for T-matrix and series expansions of fields
N = 50;

% Note that N and nNbTheta can be estimated automatically by calling
% sphEstimateNandNT, see any ScriptSolve... for example.

% m-numbers used in the calculations
% For most incident excitations and for orientation-averaged properties,
% all |m|<=N need to be considered:
absmvec = (0:1:N)';
% Advanced users can define the stIncPar first and use the following instead
% absmvec = stIncPar.absmvec.';
% or specify a single m-value for testing for example, i.e.
% absmvec = 1; % m=1 only

% Make structure describing spheroidal geometry and quadrature points for
% numerical integrations
stGeometry = sphMakeGeometry(nNbTheta, a, c);

% Make structure with incident field parameters
stIncPar = vshMakeIncidentParameters(sIncType, N);


%% Defining number of multipoles for each step
%
% The T-matrix and corresponding field expansion coefficients will be
% calculated up to n=N for all m in absmvec (note that m>=0).

% For this, we may need to calculate P and Q with more multipole,
% NQ=N+Delta [see JQSRT 160, 29 (2015)].
% This can ensure the accuracy of the entire T-matrix [see JQSRT 160, 29 (2015)].
% Delta can be estimated from the convergence of T_{11}^{22,m=1}
% with the following call (advanced users)
[Delta, T2211err]= sphEstimateDelta(stGeometry, stk1s);

% Alternatively one may simply use NQ = N and check convergence of the
% results by running a second calculation for a larger N
% [see JQSRT 160, 29 (2015)].
% Delta=0;

NQ = N+Delta;% NQ>=N: Maximum multipole order for computing P and Q matrices

% P and Q are calculated using the stable and accurate algorithm in
% [JQSRT 123, 153 (2013)].
% For this algorithm we need to specify how many extra order are needed
% to compute Bessel function products to the highest accuracy
% This can be estimated with the following function
NB=sphEstimateNB(NQ, stGeometry, stk1s);
% or can be specified by user (advanced), for example
% NB=NQ;

% the zero elements.

% To obtain the full matrices in standard form, use the following call

% since only elements P_{nk} with n,k>=m (or 1 for m=0) are needed.
